replace the path of a specific sample/plugin in a project or a directory containing projects (useful when renaming a file)
replace the prefix of a path (useful when moving a folder)
probably edit every line individually and print what line was changed in what file
overwrite or save to another directory

guess the scale from marked semitones

export project notes to html (add the lmms default color background)

backup clean up
check for every project.mmpz if it has an identical (same content/hash) project.mmpz.bak delete it
nvm i don't think hash will work because of the order of xml attributes that randomizes with each save
i think i will just compare last modified date/+file size

make functions for opening and saving files so i don't repeat the same code in every new tool

randomize automation clip based on min/max or user given values

humanizer tool
    input: xpt(z) file (midi clip)
    set minimum and maximum humanization movement (offset)
    option to not humanize notes in every customizable interval (default: bar)
    when multiple notes are played in the same time (chords)
        humanize all notes with the same value
        humanize each note with a random value
        strum:
            strum up
            strum down
            strum random direction each chord
